# Things I Say to My Kids

* Was there any way that {that thing you did} could have made things
  better? (_No_) Could it have made things worse? (_Yes_) Why would you
  do something that could only make things worse, and not make them
  better?

* Just because {something worse} exists, doesn't make {this thing} less
  bad.

* Is it worth arguing over? / Is it worth the amount of energy you're
  putting into arguing over it?

## As a Dad

* Half of you is half of me.
