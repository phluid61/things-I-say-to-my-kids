# Things I Say to My Kids

* Was there any way that {that thing you did} could have made things
  better? \
  (_No_) \
  Could it have made things worse? \
  (_Yes_) \
  Why would you do something that could only make things worse, and not
  make them better?

* Just because {something worse} exists, doesn't make {this thing} less
  bad.

* Is it worth arguing over? // Is it worth the amount of energy you're
  putting into arguing over it?

* Right now I'm not very interested in how we got here; I'm much more
  interested in where we go next, and how we get there.

* {A question?} \
  (_I don't know_) \
  I'm not asking because it's something you should know, I'm asking
  because it's something you need to choose/decide/find out.

## Things I've Only Said Once or Twice

* The reward for doing the right thing is that the right thing gets done.

* If we do things to make each other happy, we increase the happiness.

## As a Dad

* Half of you is half of me.
