# Things I Say to My Kids

* Was there any way that <that thing you did> could have made things
  better? (_No_) Could it have made things worse? (_Yes_) Why would you
  do something that could only make things worse, and not make them
  better?

* Just because <something worse> exists, doesn't make <this thing> less
  bad.

## As a Dad

* Half of you is half of me.
